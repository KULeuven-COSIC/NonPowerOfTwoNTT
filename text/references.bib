abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a configurable hardware architecture that can be used to generate unified and parametric NTT-based polynomial multipliers that support a wide range of parameters of lattice-based cryptographic schemes proposed for post-quantum cryptography. Both NTT and inverse NTT operations can be performed using the unified butterfly unit of our architecture, which constitutes the core building block in NTT operations. The multitude of this unit plays an essential role in achieving the performance goals of a specific application area or platform. To this end, the architecture takes the size of butterfly units as input and generates an efficient NTT-based polynomial multiplier hardware to achieve the desired throughput and area requirements. More specifically, the proposed hardware architecture provides run-time configurability for the scheme parameters and compile-time configurability for throughput and area requirements. This work presents the first architecture with both run-time and compile-time configurability for NTT-based polynomial multiplication operations to the best of our knowledge. The implementation results indicate that the advanced configurability has a negligible impact on the time and area of the proposed architecture and that its performance is on par with the state-of-the-art implementations in the literature, if not better. The proposed architecture comprises various sub-blocks such as modular multiplier and butterfly units, each of which can be of interest on its own for accelerating lattice-based cryptography. Thus, we provide the design rationale of each sub-block and compare it with those in the literature, including our earlier works in terms of configurability and performance.}

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Thing (IoT) systems usually have less storage and computing power than desktop systems. This paper proposes an efficient BGV-type homomorphic encryption scheme in order fit for secure computing on IoT system. Our scheme reduces the storage space for switch keys and ciphertext evaluation time comparing with previous BGV-type cryptosystems. Specifically, the switch key in homomorphic computations can be a constant but no longer one for each level. Moreover, the product of two ciphertexts can be at the same sublayer as them and the multiplication operations can be repeated between two sublayers. As a result, the multiplication times will not be limited by L in an L-level circuit and, thus, the ciphertext evaluation time will decrease significantly. We implement the scheme with the C language. The performance test shows that the efficiency of the improved scheme is better than Helib in same configurations.},

abstract="Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables processing encrypted data without decrypting it. This technology can be used, for example, to allow a public cloud to operate on secret data without the cloud learning anything about the data. Simply encrypt the secret data with homomorphic encryption before sending it to the cloud, have the cloud process the encrypted data and return the encrypted result, and finally decrypt the encrypted result. Here is a simplistic ``hello world'' example using homomorphic encryption:{\#} Every encryption needs a secret key. Let's get one of those.myEncryptionKey = generateEncryptionKey(){\#} Now we can encrypt some very secret data.encrypted5 = encrypt(myEncryptionKey, 5)encrypted12 = encrypt(myEncryptionKey, 12)excrypted2 = encrypt(myEncryptionKey, 2){\#} We have three ciphertexts now.{\#} We want the sum of the first two.{\#} Luckily we used homomorphic encryption, so we can actually do this.encrypted17 = addCiphertexts(encrypted5, encrypted12){\#} Maybe we want to multiply the result by the 3rd ciphertext.encrypted34 = multiplyCiphertexts(encrypted17, encrypted2){\#} See that? We operated on ciphertexts without needing the key.{\#} But no matter what we compute, the result is always encrypted.{\#} To actually see the final result, we have to use the key.decrypted34 = decrypt(myEncryptionKey, encrypted34)print(decrypted34) {\#} This should print '34'",
